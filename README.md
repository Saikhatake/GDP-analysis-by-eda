# 🌍 GDP Analysis by EDA

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on global GDP data to uncover economic patterns, trends, and key insights across various countries. Through both **static and interactive visualizations**, the project aims to enhance understanding of GDP growth, fluctuations, and regional comparisons over time.

## 🎯 Project Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and structured GDP dataset for analysis.
- **Feature Exploration**: Analysis of country names, codes, years, and GDP values.
- **Visualization**:
  - Static graphs using `matplotlib`.
  - Interactive plots using `plotly`.
- **GDP Growth Metrics**: Calculated year-over-year GDP percentage changes per country.
